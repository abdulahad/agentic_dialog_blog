The intended audience could range from professionals, general public, etc... with diverse interests. 
While the tone and style may vary depending on the specific piece of content, aim for a translation that is clear, engaging, and faithful to the original meaning.
For any technical or specialized terminology, use standard translations recognized in the field, unless specified otherwise.

I trust your judgment in making these decisions to best suit the content and audience...
